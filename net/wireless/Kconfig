config CFG80211
	tristate "cfg80211 - wireless configuration API"
	depends on RFKILL || !RFKILL
	---help---
	  cfg80211 is the Linux wireless LAN (802.11) configuration API.
	  Enable this if you have a wireless device.

	  For more information refer to documentation on the wireless wiki:

	  http://wireless.kernel.org/en/developers/Documentation/cfg80211

	  When built as a module it will be called cfg80211.

config NL80211_TESTMODE
	bool "nl80211 testmode command"
	depends on CFG80211
	help
	  The nl80211 testmode command helps implementing things like
	  factory calibration or validation tools for wireless chips.

	  Select this option ONLY for kernels that are specifically
	  built for such purposes.

	  Debugging tools that are supposed to end up in the hands of
	  users should better be implemented with debugfs.

	  Say N.

config CFG80211_DEVELOPER_WARNINGS
	bool "enable developer warnings"
	depends on CFG80211
	default n
	help
	  This option enables some additional warnings that help
	  cfg80211 developers and driver developers, but that can
	  trigger due to races with userspace.

	  For example, when a driver reports that it was disconnected
	  from the AP, but the user disconnects manually at the same
	  time, the warning might trigger spuriously due to races.

	  Say Y only if you are developing cfg80211 or a driver based
	  on it (or mac80211).


config CFG80211_REG_DEBUG
	bool "cfg80211 regulatory debugging"
	depends on CFG80211
	default n
	---help---
	  You can enable this if you want to debug regulatory changes.
	  For more information on cfg80211 regulatory refer to the wireless
	  wiki:

	  http://wireless.kernel.org/en/developers/Regulatory

	  If unsure, say N.

config CFG80211_DEFAULT_PS
	bool "enable powersave by default"
	depends on CFG80211
	default y
	help
	  This option enables powersave mode by default.

	  If this causes your applications to misbehave you should fix your
	  applications instead -- they need to register their network
	  latency requirement, see Documentation/power/pm_qos_interface.txt.

config CFG80211_DEBUGFS
	bool "cfg80211 DebugFS entries"
	depends on CFG80211
	depends on DEBUG_FS
	---help---
	  You can enable this if you want to debugfs entries for cfg80211.

	  If unsure, say N.

config CFG80211_INTERNAL_REGDB
	bool "use statically compiled regulatory rules database" if EMBEDDED
	default n
	depends on CFG80211
	---help---
	  This option generates an internal data structure representing
	  the wireless regulatory rules described in net/wireless/db.txt
	  and includes code to query that database.  This is an alternative
	  to using CRDA for defining regulatory rules for the kernel.

	  For details see:

	  http://wireless.kernel.org/en/developers/Regulatory

	  Most distributions have a CRDA package.  So if unsure, say N.

config CFG80211_WEXT
	bool "cfg80211 wireless extensions compatibility"
	depends on CFG80211
	select WEXT_CORE
	default y
	help
	  Enable this option if you need old userspace for wireless
	  extensions with cfg80211-based drivers.

config WIRELESS_OLD_REGULATORY
	bool "Old wireless static regulatory definitions"
	default y
	---help---
	  This option enables the old static regulatory information
	  and uses it within the new framework. This is available
	  temporarily as an option to help prevent immediate issues
	  due to the switch to the new regulatory framework which
	  does require a new userspace application which has the
	  database of regulatory information (CRDA) and another for
	  setting regulatory domains (iw).

	  For more information see:

	  http://wireless.kernel.org/en/developers/Regulatory/CRDA
	  http://wireless.kernel.org/en/users/Documentation/iw

	  It is important to note though that if you *do* have CRDA present
	  and if this option is enabled CRDA *will* be called to update the
	  regulatory domain (for US and JP only). Support for letting the user
	  set the regulatory domain through iw is also supported. This option
	  mainly exists to leave around for a kernel release some old static
	  regulatory domains that were defined and to keep around the old
	  ieee80211_regdom module parameter. This is being phased out and you
	  should stop using them ASAP.

	  Note: You will need CRDA if you want 802.11d support

	  Say Y unless you have installed a new userspace application.
	  Also say Y if have one currently depending on the ieee80211_regdom
	  module parameter and cannot port it to use the new userspace
	  interfaces.

config WIRELESS_EXT
	bool "Wireless extensions"
	default n
	---help---
	  This option enables the legacy wireless extensions
	  (wireless network interface configuration via ioctls.)

	  Wireless extensions will be replaced by cfg80211 and
	  will be required only by legacy drivers that implement
	  wireless extension handlers. This option does not
	  affect the wireless-extension backward compatibility
	  code in cfg80211.

	  Say N (if you can) unless you know you need wireless
	  extensions for external modules.

config WIRELESS_EXT_SYSFS
	bool "Wireless extensions sysfs files"
	default y
	depends on WEXT_CORE && SYSFS
	help
	  This option enables the deprecated wireless statistics
	  files in /sys/class/net/*/wireless/. The same information
	  is available via the ioctls as well.

	  Say Y if you have programs using it, like old versions of
	  hal.

config LIB80211
	tristate "Common routines for IEEE802.11 drivers"
	default n
	help
	  This options enables a library of common routines used
	  by IEEE802.11 wireless LAN drivers.

	  Drivers should select this themselves if needed.  Say Y if
	  you want this built into your kernel.

config LIB80211_CRYPT_WEP

config LIB80211_DEBUG
	bool "lib80211 debugging messages"
	depends on LIB80211
	default n
	---help---
	  You can enable this if you want verbose debugging messages
	  from lib80211.

	  If unsure, say N.
